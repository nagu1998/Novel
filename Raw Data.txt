Assume you are dying tommore and u have one day to left to cherrish or re live the moments u had lived in your life

Maturity : when girls start wearing bra and when boys start removing bra

I said, 
'thank you so much sir', someone said right behind me. 
he said
gopal asked
he said/gopal said
'nice house', i said as i sat on a cushy brown velvet sofa.
'How do you know? I said.
we laughed.
he smiled
how old are you? i was curious.
i said instead[u can use any one word to complete it with an emotion or feel]
Ten acres? 1 made a guess 
at what time do you eat dinner? he asked.
gopal shook his head.
'looks like we will have to break the door', the maid said.
he/gopal looked surprised
he asked again.
'lazy parents, bread-butter again', i grimmbled again
he suggested
raghav stared at me? 'confess', he whispered.
i whispered back.
my father said
baba asked 
dubey uncle replied.
i thought
she winked/blinked
i shrugged,
i shrugged my shoulder

i nodded.


============================================================================================================================
Felt relax and went outside
Interacting with mobile more than their parents around the people
Lowered her jacket zip bcz sweat and all stuff
Paneer cheese sandwich with strawberry smoothie 



I believe the person who is silent or who doesn’t share the things about him or her 
over the person who over shares about him or her. Bcz the person who hides the things
he hides all the things but the person who over shares he or she shares only the things
they wants to share.



Last day he will give her dairy.
he will get to know her bday the next day or on same day 
he will read till the day before her bday.
about his dad's surprise that became surprise for rest of her life.
